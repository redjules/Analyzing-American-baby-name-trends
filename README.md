# Analyzing American baby name trends

In this project, I've studied data provided by the U.S. Social Security Administration containing first names, which were given to over 5,000 American babies each year for the period of 101 years. The main goal is to understand how American baby name tastes changed by investigating trends of popularity. In particular, we're going to discover:

Classic American names for over 100 years
- The type of popularity for each name: timeless vs. trendy
- The top 10 female names
- The most popular female name ending in "a" since 2015
- The most popular male names by year
- The most popular male name for the largest number of years
